 # SOLID PRINCIPLES



## 1 Single Responsibility
every class, module, or 
function in a program should have one responsibility and purpose

## 2 Open-Closed Principle

##### --> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.


## 3 Liskov substitution principle

#### he principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

# 4 Interface Segregation Principle
## Clients should not be forced to implement a function they do no need

# 5 Dependency Inversion Principle
## High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
## Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
